Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js
==============

This project contains the slides and code from my talk
"Designing Beautiful Maps with D3.js". In it, you will find code examples
for using D3.js to build a variety of thematic maps. Each map is numbered
and builds on one another, with each map showing off a different aspect
of map making with D3 that I wanted to highlight. The maps show off various
SVG and CSS techniques as well as how to use D3 to apply different projections,
color scales, and animations.
